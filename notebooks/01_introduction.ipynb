    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of the A-MCTS algorithm for temporal path discovery in Attributed Dynamic Graphs (ADGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is A-MCTS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (A-MCTS) is an algorithm designed for finding optimal paths in temporal networks with multiple constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- Incorporates a replay memory mechanism to improve search efficiency\n",
    "- Utilizes edge embeddings to capture structural similarities\n",
    "- Adapts search parameters based on past experience\n",
    "- Optimizes for multi-attribute constraints in dynamic environments"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Find the shortest path in a temporal network that satisfies a set of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In temporal networks, edges are available only at specific time intervals, and they have multiple attributes (e.g., cost, time, reliability). The A-MCTS algorithm aims to find a path from a source node to a destination node that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Respects the temporal constraints (edges can only be traversed at valid times)\n",
    "2. Satisfies the attribute constraints (e.g., total cost below a certain threshold)\n",
    "3. Minimizes the path length\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a challenging problem because:\n",
    "- The search space is massive\n",
    "- Traditional search algorithms don't handle temporal constraints well\n",
    "- Multiple attribute constraints create a multi-objective optimization problem"

    "## Algorithm Components\n",

    "A-MCTS consists of several key components:\n",

    "1. **AttributedDynamicGraph**: Represents the temporal network with edges having attributes\n",
    "2. **TemporalPath**: Represents a path in the temporal network\n",
    "3. **EdgeEmbedding**: Creates embeddings for edges to capture structural similarity\n",
    "4. **ReplayMemory**: Stores past search experiences for efficient lookup\n",
    "5. **TreeNode**: Represents a node in the search tree\n",
    "6. **AMCTS**: The main algorithm that orchestrates the search process\n",

    "## How A-MCTS Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm follows the standard MCTS procedure with some adaptations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection**: Use the UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees) formula to select nodes for expansion, but with an adaptive exploration weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expansion**: Expand the selected node by trying a new action.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulation**: Run a simulation from the expanded node until reaching a terminal state (destination or dead-end).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backpropagation**: Update the statistics of all nodes in the path, including average reward and visit counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adaptations include:\n",
    "- Using a replay memory to store and retrieve past experiences\n",
    "- Incorporating edge embeddings to capture structural similarity\n",
    "- Using an adaptive exploration weight based on the node's statistics"
